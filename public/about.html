            <p id="para-01">Against All Snippets is a web app designed to teach code tracing to beginner programmers and 
                to help experienced programmers hone their skills. The web app is designed to be like an RPG
                (role-playing game) where you defeat enemies by solving code tracing problems.

                The inspiration behind this web app are online practice tools like Monkeytype, LeetCode, and Flexbox Froggy. 
                And the theme inspiration are fantasy RPG games and media which gave me the idea to implement a scoring system
                just like in a game to make the experience more interactive and immersive.
